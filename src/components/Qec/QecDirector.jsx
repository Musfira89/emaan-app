        <p>We extend warm thankfulness to Quality Assurance Agency of Higher Education Commission for establishing QECs in Institutions private as well as in public. The initiative will facilitate the Higher Education Institutions and Degree Awarding Institutions to enhance their quality of education and programs at National and International criteria. We firmly believe that QECs work in closely with each other as it will embark a synergistic effect on our educational set-up. Mean while, the QEC staff at our Institution leaves no stone unturned to create a quality culture of education for its stakeholders in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we rationalize our procedures and work on the refrain of ‘’ownership and execution’’, we can achieve new statures of success. It’s great time that we should take some evocative and real steps to assure quality education and this could be possible if we make our assessment systems valid and reliable. </p>
